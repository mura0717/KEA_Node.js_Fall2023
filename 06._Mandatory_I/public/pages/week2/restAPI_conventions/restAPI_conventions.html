    <p>
        In REST, the primary data representation is called resource. 
        Having a consistent and robust REST resource naming strategy 
        will prove one of the best design decisions in the long term.

        A resource can be a singleton or a collection.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, "customers" is a collection resource and a "customer" is a singleton resource.
    </p>

<h4>Example of a RestAPI Design:</h4>
<pre><code>
    GET     /customers
    GET     /customers/{id} 
    POST    /customers
    PATCH   /customers/{id}
    PUT     /customers/{id}
    DELETE  /customers/{id}
</code></pre>
