    <h1>Structuring HTML with Semantic HTML</h1>

<div class="page-content">
    <p>
        HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages. <br>
        It consists of elements that tells the browser how to display them. <br>
    </p>
    <p>
        With over 100 HTML elements, and the ability to create custom elements, <br>
        there are infinite ways to mark up your content; but some ways -semanticallyâ€” are better than others.
    </p>
    <p>
        Semantic means "relating to meaning". Writing semantic HTML means using HTML elements <br>
        to structure your content based on each element's meaning, not its appearance.
    </p>

    <h4>An exampel code with elements without semantic value:</h4>
    <pre><code>
        <div>
            <span>Three words</span>
            <div>
              <a>one word</a>
              <a>one word</a>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div>
            <div>
              <div>five words</div>
            </div>
            <div>
              <div>three words</div>
              <div>forty-six words</div>
            </div>
    </code></pre>

    <h4>Same code - rewritten with semantic elements:</h4>
    <pre><code>
        <header>
            <h1>Three words</h1>
            <nav>
              <a>one word</a>
              <a>one word</a>
            </nav>
          </header>
          <main>
            <header>
              <h1>five words</h1>
            </header>
            <section>
              <h2>three words</h2>
              <p>forty-six words</p>
            </section>
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        As seen in the second code block, semantic elements allow the HTML structure <br>
        to be understood even without understanding the content, as they also provide meaning.
