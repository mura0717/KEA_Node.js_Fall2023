    <p>
        Cross-site Scripting (XSS) is a client-side code injection attack.  <br>
        The attacker aims to execute malicious scripts in a web browser of the victim by including malicious code in a legitimate web page or web application.
    </p>

    <h3>Types of XSS:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Reflected XSS, where the malicious script comes from the current HTTP request.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stored XSS, where the malicious script comes from the website's database. 
        </li>
        <li>
            DOM-based XSS, where the vulnerability exists in client-side code rather than
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How Cross-Site Scripting Works:</h3>
    <p>
        Cross-site scripting works by manipulating a vulnerable web site so that it returns malicious JavaScript to users. <br>
        When the malicious code executes inside a victim's browser, the attacker can fully compromise their interaction with the application.

    <h3>How to Avoid it?</h3>
    <p>
        Allowing "safe" HTML by trying to filter out potentially harmful tags and JavaScript. <br>
        You can try to implement this using a whitelist of safe tags and attributes. <br>
        By using a JS library, such as '<strong>DOMpurify</strong>', which strips out everything that contains dangerous HTML, and returns a string with clean HTML.
